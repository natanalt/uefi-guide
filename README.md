# A Comprehensive Guide To UEFI Programming
This repo contains my attempt at writing a book about UEFI application programming.

## Building
```sh
# You need mdbook, installable via the Rust package manager
cargo install mdbook

# 1. If you want to locally host the book (let's say for writing), run:
mdbook serve

# 2. If you want to just build the book, run:
mdbook build
```

## Motivations
UEFI is a major pain to use. I would've loved such a book.
